# Application Overview

BillTracker allows users to see expenses that occur each month. Some of them may be car insurance, healthcare coverage, dental insurance, streaming services, cellular services, rent, credit card payments etc. Instead of remembering all bills due a month the user can use this application as note taking for bills .   
To help relieve stress BillTracker allows users to take a look at their upcoming bills and plan their finances accordingly.

# Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Log-in and Register (desktop)

![Log-in and Register](WelcomePage.jpeg)

Background of the log-in and register page is an example of the look of the app to attract users to register. Having a register window on the page makes it easier to register. Register window consists of fields with first name, last name, email and password. For existing users we have the sign in window that requires email and password.

### 1.2 Navigation

When a user hover over a date an option to Add a Bill appears. Once clicked it opens a form with fields for bills information. Basic information is the bill’s name and amount and optional is payment information. Users can paste a link to their bill’s payment information for easier future allocation of the page, or they can put what card they are using and that way they know where the money will be taken from.
